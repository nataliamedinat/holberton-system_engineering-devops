Global variables or environment variables are available in all shells. The env or printenv commands can be used to display environment variables. These programs come with the sh-utils package.
The alias command is built into a number of shells including ash, bash (the default shell on most Linux systems), csh and ksh. It is one of several ways to customize the shell (another is setting environmental variables). Aliases are recognized only by the shell in which they are created, and they apply only for the user that creates them, unless that user is the root (i.e., administrative) user, which can create aliases for any user.
